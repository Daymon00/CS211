#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
string first, last;
int age;
    cout << "Enter your first and last name." << endl;  //We put 2 strings because fullName string can only store 1 word and a full name has 2 words
    cin >> first >> last;  //take the first and second input from user 
    cout << "Enter your age." << endl;
    cin >> age;
    cout << "You are " << age << " years old, " << first << " " << last << endl;// output first and last with age.
